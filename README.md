### General Info
This project was really cool, and I am currently making another movie app to build off of the knowledge I gained from this one.
Here I fetched the api, and deconstructed a movie variable to access multiple data entries from the api and store them into the movie variable.
I then used a template literal to insert the information into a movie div that I created, and appended that to my HTML.
